# dirt_to_shirt
Website for Olin College of Engineering "From Dirt to Shirt" Class

Want to help?
I'm at anusha@students.olin.edu. the things left to do are:


- Make thumbnail images out of all the images anna sent. Or just dimension
them nicely. I don't actually know what I'm doing, they just need to be small
- Load content onto the about.html page. There's a lot of it
- An image gallery or slideshow could be really nice, maybe at the top of the 
about page if it's too busy on the homepage
- Add all of the thumbnail images to an /images directory where each is the
  name of the garment
- Add all of the content as html pages to a /content directory where each is 
  the name of the garment. Include a navbar and title at minimum
