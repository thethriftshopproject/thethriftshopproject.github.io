<p>The boy dashed to a small street at the back of the cinema. He turned left, dodged an old lady and rushed to a dimly-lit alley leading to a place that nobody would wish to be. Within a few seconds, he escaped the bright crowded street just to throw himself into a maze of dark alleys. In Saigon, one wrong turn would lead to a mysterious place, but the boy knew all the twists and turns like the back of his hand. So he kept running. He needed to run. He needed to make intricate turns.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the boy stopped. Tuan was there, in front of him, waiting. </p>
<p>From behind, he could hear the footsteps getting nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>They were coming. The gang was coming and he knew it.</p>
<p>He also knew that in order to escape, he needed to dash forward and use all his strength to push Tuan away. So he ran towards Tuan, who was twice as big as he was. </p>
<p>As he reached Tuan, the boy was caught and pushed backward. A hand from behind grabbed his neck, pulling him to the ground. As the boy fell, he knew that he would be beaten. So he covered his face and pulled back his body. One kick from the left; another from behind. There was nothing he could do, so he just lay there in pain as the kicks and punches came at him from all sides.</p>
<p>“Next time I see you selling gum in this area, you’ll be dead.” Tuan shouted at him. The gang got bored after kicking him for 15 minutes and they were now leaving. After they left, the boy was still lying there; for how long, he didn’t know, but he knew that it hurt when he moved his body. Still, he needed to stand up. He headed home, with his whole body aching.</p>
<p>The boy hated to be beaten. He always hated it and he wanted to get older, to be stronger. His eight-year-old self wanted to get revenge, to defeat those guys who had beaten him. Amidst the pain and the anger, he became aware of an annoying itch on the back of his neck. “What is it?” He then checked his neck: it was the tag.</p>
<p>Yes, the tag. The tag from the worn-out T-shirt he got from his late grandma, his only family member who had passed away just three months before. He really loved the T-shirt, especially the tag because it looked dark and mysterious like the streets he had run through. But the tag was torn from one end, causing the unpleasant itch behind his neck. Suddenly, the boy could feel the intense anger that began to burn inside of him. He ripped off the tag from his T-shirt and was about to toss it away. But just before he let it go, the boy looked at the tag: the word WHIRL on it somehow calmed him down. He missed his grandma. He hated the memories of being beaten and of losing his grandma, but he still loved the tag. At that moment, he knew that he wanted to keep the tag more than to throw it away.</p>
<p>Yet, he didn’t know that sometimes, we just treasure the memories that hurt the most.</p>
