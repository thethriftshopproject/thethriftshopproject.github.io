<p>Alex was a pretty typical 17 year old. She liked music, read sci-fi novels, and played the violin. But if there was one thing Alex knew she hated, it was flowers. She was allergic to pollen, she thought the petals were messy, and the smell made her sick to her stomach. She found them uninspiring, cliche, and reminiscent of a funeral. Specifically, her mother’s. The image of her mother’s coffin covered in white flowers constantly haunted her thoughts. On principle, she avoided anything floral to spare herself the thought of them. From head to toe, Alex dressed in solid colors and geometric shapes. She would throw in the occasional wavy abstract pattern, but if a piece of clothing had a single flower on it, she avoided it like the plague. <br>
It was April of her senior year. With graduation just around the corner, Alex was busy preparing for her senior concert. She was playing Winter for Vivaldi’s Four Seasons; a complex piece that showed off the precision and skill gained from years of practice. Now the only thing left was to decide on an dress for the concert. <br>
Before she had passed away three years ago, Alex’s mother had been the biggest supporter in her violin career. She was the one who had encouraged Alex to start taking lessons at age seven, and she had always pushed Alex to challenge herself. <br>
Alex arrived home from an unsuccessful dress shopping trip mentally and physically exhausted. She had scoured the whole mall and nothing was quite right. When she got to her room there was a box and a note sitting on her bed. Picking it up, she read:<br>
    Dear Al,<br>
<br>
    Your mom bought this a few years ago. She was saving it to wear it to your 
concert. She would be so proud of you.<br>
<br>
-Dad<br>
Opening the box, Alex found a dress. It was a full length, sleeveless dress made out of a smooth black fabric. The whole thing was covered in beautiful embroidery, twisting vines with delicate leaves and intertwined in the pattern, flowers. Hundreds of little white flowers absolutely covered the garment.<br>
Alex was struck with simultaneous feelings of awe and grief. How could fate be so cruel as to even present her with this dress. She had spent the last couple years hiding from anything that reminded her of her mother's funeral, yet here she was, faced with a gift from her mother that felt like a smack in the face. <br>
A month later, Alex was standing on stage in her mother’s dress. In the last three weeks, Alex had learned an entirely new piece for the concert. As she played the final notes of Spring from Vivaldi’s Four Seasons and the audience cheered, Alex began to cry. Gone were the days when Alex shunned the memory of her mother; this was her chance for a new start. Someone had thrown a bouquet on stage, and she was surrounded by little white flowers.
