<p>She settles into her chair.</p>
<p>The one she’s sat in for the past 12 years,</p>
<p>In this Massachusetts clothing factory.</p>
<br>
<p>Her hands thread the needle</p>
<p>While her mind wanders off.</p>
<p>The first shirt of hundreds lands on her desk.</p>
<br>
<p>She sews on button after button,</p>
<p>Eight on each shirt.</p>
<p>The gold button shines on the black cloth.</p>
<p>Yet again her mind wanders off.</p>
<br>
<p>Each button is</p>
<p>A story,</p>
<p>A person,</p>
<p>A reason</p>
<p>She has stayed at this job.</p>
<br>
<p>The fist button is her son,</p>
<p>The one constant in her life.</p>
<p>He was 1 when she started at the factory,</p>
<p>The only reason she even applied.</p>
<p>Her whole world lives in his eyes.</p>
<br>
<p>The second is her sick mother,</p>
<p>Who lives in a hospital bed.</p>
<p>This button signifies the 8th of her pay check</p>
<p>She sends her each week.</p>
<br>
<p>The third is education,</p>
<p>Her own</p>
<p>And her sons’.</p>
<p>Her night classes</p>
<p>And his primary school.</p>
<p>The only way up.</p>
<br>
<p>The fourth is home,</p>
<p>The small one she can provide.</p>
<p>The place where she rests her head,</p>
<p>Where her son gets to play.</p>
<br>
<p>The fifth is food,</p>
<p>Which at times can be hard to provide.</p>
<p>Her son eats before her.</p>
<p>She can go hungry.</p>
<p>His growing body cannot.</p>
<br>
<p>The sixth is the American Dream,</p>
<p>The ideal she stills believes in,</p>
<p>The dream she hopes her son can achieve.</p>
<br>
<p>The seventh is her,</p>
<p>So close to the end,</p>
<p>The end of her wits,</p>
<p>her energy,</p>
<p>Her patience,</p>
<p>The end of this opportunity.</p>
<br>
<p>The eighth button,</p>
<p>The last,</p>
<p>Is this factory</p>
<p>The last of its kind</p>
<p>The last clothing plant in the USA</p>
<p>Today is its’ closing day.</p>
<br>
<p>She sews on the last button</p>
<p>On the last shirt,</p>
<p>The last little gold speckle,</p>
<p>She’ll ever attach.</p>
<br>
<p>She thinks about her</p>
<p>Fellow seamstresses</p>
<p>In lands far away</p>
<p>Who will still get to sew day after day</p>
<p>Until robots take it all away.</p>
