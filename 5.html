<p>She settles into her chair.<br>
    The one she’s sat in for the past 12 years,<br>
In this Massachusetts clothing factory.<br>
<br>
Her hands thread the needle<br>
While her mind wanders off.<br>
The first shirt of hundreds lands on her desk.<br>
<br>
She sews on button after button,<br>
Eight on each shirt.<br>
The gold button shines on the black cloth.<br>
Yet again her mind wanders off.<br>
<br>
Each button is<br>
A story,<br>
A person,<br>
A reason<br>
She has stayed at this job.<br>
<br>
The fist button is her son,<br>
The one constant in her life.<br>
He was 1 when she started at the factory,<br>
The only reason she even applied.<br>
Her whole world lives in his eyes.<br>
<br>
The second is her sick mother,<br>
Who lives in a hospital bed.<br>
This button signifies the 8th of her pay check<br>
She sends her each week.<br>
<br>
The third is education,<br>
Her own<br>
And her sons’.<br>
Her night classes<br>
And his primary school.<br>
The only way up.<br>
<br>
The fourth is home,<br>
The small one she can provide.<br>
The place where she rests her head,<br>
Where her son gets to play.<br>
<br>
The fifth is food,<br>
Which at times can be hard to provide.<br>
Her son eats before her.<br>
She can go hungry.<br>
His growing body cannot.<br>
<br>
The sixth is the American Dream,<br>
The ideal she stills believes in,<br>
The dream she hopes her son can achieve.<br>
<br>
The seventh is her,<br>
So close to the end,<br>
The end of her wits,<br>
her energy,<br>
Her patience,<br>
The end of this opportunity.<br>
<br>
The eighth button,<br>
The last,<br>
Is this factory<br>
The last of its kind<br>
The last clothing plant in the USA<br>
Today is its’ closing day.<br>
<br>
She sews on the last button<br>
On the last shirt,<br>
The last little gold speckle,<br>
She’ll ever attach.<br>
<br>
She thinks about her<br>
Fellow seamstresses<br>
In lands far away<br>
Who will still get to sew day after day
Until robots take it all away.</p></body>
