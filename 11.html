<p>“Oi! Did you hear?”</p>
<p>I cocked my ear toward the sound of the door opening. “Hear what?”</p>
<p>“They’re closing down the factory.” </p>
<p>The news didn’t surprise me. The workers, the company, the public - everyone had been saying it would for a long time now. One by one the other factories had closed, until the only one left was the one here, in Baltimore.</p> 
<p>“I suppose time would have to run out eventually. But I didn’t think it would happen like this.” Her words were sour and angry, and her shoulders slumped in defeat. I knew that she felt she was somehow to blame, though no worker could have prevented it. I remember how the president had told us workers that we were the ones that would determine the success of the factory’s last-ditch efforts were to be successful.</p> 
<p>She walked over to the coat closet and pulled out my nice coat, a beautiful trench coat made in the very same factory we worked in. It was years old, but I loved it just the same as when I had gathered the money to buy it. Draping it over her arm, she began fiddling with the buttons.</p>
<p>“The buttons we use haven’t changed at all, huh? You think you were the one to put these on?”</p>
<p>I took it from her hands. “I wouldn’t be surprised, God knows how many of these I’ve sewn on in my lifetime.” Turning my attention toward it, I lifted the coat up and fingered at the stitched label. “London Fog - Weather wear of distinction,” I mumbled to myself, “Made in U.S.A.”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow they’re going to tell the world we’re shutting down in about two months. The company president himself came and told us so. Couldn’t compete with business overseas.” </p>
<p>I scowled at that thought. Of course our factory couldn’t compete with the mere cents an hour a worker cost overseas. Was I really so naïve as to believe we could keep the factory up and running? It seemed things might work out for a while, when the company had put $2 million into the factory to keep it going. Those in charge had hoped that our Baltimore factory could serve a purpose, turning out and distributing coats quicker than it could be done from overseas. I suppose that hope wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>I looked back up to her. “You think the buttons will be different there? I suppose they wouldn’t be.”</p>
<p>“Nah. I figure they’ll sew them on just the same, no matter what country they’re in.” She laughed bitterly. “Things are changing, but it’s not with the buttons.”</p>
