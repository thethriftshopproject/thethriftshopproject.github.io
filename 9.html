<p>The morning I lost my sweater was awful. I had just taken the red-eye flight from New York back to Boston. I take a lot of flights for my job as a journalist – always red-eye because of my condition, and must have been so tired I missed my luggage at the airport. And of course I couldn’t just go get my luggage when the sun is out, that’s crazy. I’d be a pile of dust faster than I could blink. <br>
That was my favorite sweater. I got it the week before I acquired my condition. It was on sale at Macy’s, and I decided I would spoil myself a little: it was a thick blue sweater, 100% cotton. I had just finished a good story and had some extra money, so I splurged on it. <br>
And then I got turned. I had no idea what to do with myself after, I mean, I didn’t need as much money, and yet without working, my life felt mostly pointless. The toughest thing was finding ways to get blood, but now I have a guy who works at the blood bank who can hook me up. After I settled into my new lifestyle, I decided to get back into writing. I always like finding a good story to share with the world. Being limited to nighttime excursions, I decided to pursue stories about urban nightlife. Currently, I’m focusing on night clubs. There are a lot of things that go on in night clubs that I can write about. Right now I am focusing on how people with my condition integrate into the night scene. <br>
Did I mention that I’m writing for a magazine, The Nighttime? This magazine mostly covers scandals, and it’s pretty famous. It’s not the best job, but it keeps me occupied. Maybe in the next hundred years I’ll start my own magazine, focusing more on fashion. That’s what I used to write about; I would interview all the famous designers, who I saw in person at the fashion shows, for Vogue. Oh well, I guess when you get turned you have to give a few things up.<br> 
But anyway, back to my sweater. This past weekend, I decided to try and find another sweater like it; it is a classic style after all, and I still look good in royal blue. Also, long sleeves protect me from the sun. Luckily, it’s getting closer to winter, which meant the sun has been setting around 4:30, so I can go out to the shops before they close. I went to the local thrift store, and then I saw it, on the corner rack. My very own thick, soft, warm blue sweater with thin black stripes. Do you know that feeling when you put the last piece in the puzzle, like everything is going in the right direction, you finally reached your goal? That’s how it felt. Who says vampires don’t have feelings? </p>
