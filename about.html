        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p> This project was created by students from two classes at Olin College. “Dirt to Shirt” (Prof. Caitrin Lynch) and “Return Design” (Prof. Tim Sauder) partnered with the Needham Community Council on a project focusing on the "after-life" of clothing. Each “Dirt to Shirt” Student created clothing stories and art objects to be presented and sold at the Needham Winter Arts Festival (where 30 local artists will sell their work) on Saturday, December 9, 2017 at Needham Town Hall (10 am to 3 pm). Each object, with its story, will be for sale; all proceeds will be donated to the Needham Community Council Thrift Shop. The sales are tax-deductible donations, receipts will be provided. For info on the Needham Community Council, see http://needhamcommunitycouncil.org/. For the art show flyer, see http://bit.ly/2AmeguC. </p>

        <p>The goal of the Thrift Shop Project is to encourage people in our community think about where our clothes are made and by whom, and to consider what happens to our clothing when we are finished with it. We all are daily participants in the global apparel supply chain, but it’s rare for us to think much about it. By creating and selling an artifact that leverages stories about the production and consumption of clothing, our class project will raise awareness of the diverse impacts of the global apparel system. </p>
 		<p>Inspired by the Significant Objects experiment (http://significantobjects.com/), ultimately, we aim to show how, in the words of the creators of the Significant Objects experiment, “Narrative transforms insignificant objects into significant ones.” How can an original fictional story give meaning to an item of clothing bought at a thrift store? </p>
		<p> Each item includes a resin-embedded item that was removed from the garment, a stand, a USB with the entire collection of images and stories, and a unique carry bag. It also comes with a printed copy of a photo of the original garment and the short story. </p>
