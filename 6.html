<p>The hum of sewing machines is numbing for her. It clears her mind and lets her think. She has been working in this Beijing garment factory for the last four years and she’s no longer bothered by the noise of the machines. They used to give her a headache. She sits in her chair and sews collars onto bright pink, silk shirts. Batches of shirts. Hundreds, thousands. She works day after day, never-ending hours. Over her time working at this garment factory there has been one thing always on her mind: her four-year-old daughter, Mei Li. She knows Mei Li wishes she could see her mother more often.  <br>
A new stack of bright pink fabric lands on her table, interrupting her thoughts. She spots a small unattached fabric fragment nestled in the pile and grabs it. She then quickly grabs her scissors that are in her apron front pocket and cuts it into a little heart before tucking it into her dress pocket. Whenever she can, she makes these little tokens for Mei Li. They signify her love. Bringing fabric out of the factory is a risk, but it’s one she’s willing to take to give her daughter something that can comfort her daughter when she cannot be with her.<br>
She remembers this morning’s conversation as she was saying goodbye to her mother and Mei Li before setting off for to work.  Mei Li looked up from her breakfast and asked her, “Why do you need to leave māmā?” She replied, “Because my heart is so full of love for you darling. It hurts me to not see you in every waking moment, but I must work in order to provide for you.” <br>
 She feels stuck, working in a sweatshop is the best job available to her. She had to uproot her whole family and move them from rural China into the city to have this opportunity. She feels pressure to work at an alarmingly fast pace, the dust from the textiles often sends her into coughing fits, and the wage is not as high as she needs to support her family. But a steady income is better than what her other options would offer her. She desperately hopes for a better future for her daughter. She dreams that Mei Li will work hard and get an education so she can get a better job. These thoughts run through her head as she expertly pushes another silk cloth into the sewing machine, the cloth moves away from her as the thread joins the collar and grabs to the body. After another extremely long shift, she gets home too late into the night to see her daughter awake. She gives Mei Li a kiss on her head, then places the heart on the pillow beside her. Mei Li will find it when she wakes up in the morning. It pains her to see her daughter so little, but it’s what she needs to do in order to survive.</p>
